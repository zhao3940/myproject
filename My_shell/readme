# Introduction
A simple simulation of shell in Linux
And this sample shell has many bugs  
when you run this shell, the shell would read input from input file, and you could contral it
# Usage
1.type gcc -o msh msh.c 
2. type msh to run the shell
3. tyoe exit to exit the shell
# Attention
This shell only can run single commands or command with less than 5 arguments 
     *format
     1. command_name
     2. command_name agr[0]
     3. command_name agr[0] agr[1]
     4. command_name agr[0] agr[1] agr[2]
     5. command_name agr[0] agr[1] agr[2] agr[3]
#command 
	 1. alias : there are space between "=", and only singl word work for alias, e.g., alias ns = ls -al
	2. PATH : type PATH you could see the information
	3. export PATH = $PATH   local path extension, there are spaces between "=", and  local path extension start with :/ and there are space between sPATH and  local path extension.
	4. history: !! ![ ]  would be not in history, and it could display last 30 item history and start with number 0.
	if the total items are bigger than 30, the newest item would cover the oldest iterm.
	So, only last 30 item history would work for this shell. if you type !31, in fact the shell would excuate number 1 command line which weres tored 
# File List
 msh.c : main program
 mshrc : test file, you could change file to change the output of program
